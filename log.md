# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an interesting challenge today. Designed an algorithm to check if an array has a majority element in it

**Thoughts:** I'm getting better in python. At least I can remember the syntax and avoid searching for the right keyword or the correct sintax.
